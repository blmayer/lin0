lin0 (linux zero) is a super minimal source-based
linux meta-distribution, primarily aimed at power
users or minimalism enthusiasts. it was born from
exercises in how minimal a linux system can get.

the distro features a barebones system built from
scratch:

- the linux kernel, without initrd
- musl libc
- mksh (the myr korn shell)
- tcc (tiny C compiler)
- toybox
- simple configs and a shell script init

all the rest it optional and can be built from
this if needed.


<b>release notes</b>

v0.0.1: initial release


<b>images</b>

if you don't want to build the whole system we
provide a tarball without the kernel so you can
build just the kernel, or copy it from somewhere.

- <a href=rootfs-x86_64.tar.xz download>rootfs.tar.xz (x86_64)</a>
- <a href=rootfs-aarch64.tar.xz download>rootfs.tar.xz (aarch64)</a>


<b>usage</b>

after built the system should boot to a login
prompt, the default user is root and password is
lin0.


<b>installation</b>


<i>from source</i>

clone this repo with:

	git clone https://terminal.pink/lin0

the installation is a 3-step process:

- copy your kconfig to <i>configs/MODEL-linux.config</i>
- run ./make.sh, this will build the system
- copy the generated rootfs to your target system

the installer will copy any extra packages present
at the pkg folder to your rootfs/share/pkg folder.


<i>from tarball</i>

if you downloaded the tarball you can simply untar
it to your destination partition. then copy your
kernel to the boot folder.
