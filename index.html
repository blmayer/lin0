the distro features a barebones system built from
scratch:

- the linux kernel, without initrd
- musl libc
- mksh (the myr korn shell)
- tcc (tiny C compiler)
- toybox
- simple configs and a shell script init

all the rest is optional and can be built from
this if needed. we provide optimized configurations
for some platforms.


<b>release notes</b>

v0.0.2: improved compiler toolchain
v0.0.1: initial release


<b>images</b>

if you don't want to build the whole system we
provide system images in various formats so you can
start with a ready environment.


<i>tarballs</i>

our tarballs are compressed with xz, thus .tar.xz
files, these are targeted at platforms, and do not
include the linux kernel:

v0.0.2:

- <a href=rootfs-x86_64.tar.xz download>x86_64</a> [3.3Mb]

v0.0.1

- <a href=rootfs-arm64.tar.xz download>arm64</a> [3.0Mb]

and for specific platforms, including the kernel:

- <a href=rootfs-hpelitedesk.tar.xz download>hp elite desk 800 g1</a> [13Mb]
- <a href=rootfs-pinebookpro.tar.xz download>pinebook pro</a> [13Mb]
- <a href=rootfs-rpi3b+.tar.xz download>raspiberry pi 3b+</a> [26Mb]


<i>docker</i>

we also provide <a href="//hub.docker.com/r/bleemayer/lin0">docker images</a> for quick testing or
building applications. this image features an easy
way to use musl libc and the tcc compiler.

	docker push bleemayer/lin0:latest

architectures supported are the same as tarballs.


<b>usage</b>

after built the system should boot to a login
prompt, the default user is root and password is
lin0.


<b>installation</b>


<i>from source</i>

clone this repo with:

	git clone https://terminal.pink/lin0

the installation is a 3-step process:

- copy your kconfig to <i>configs/MODEL-linux.config</i>
- run platform=PLATFORM ./make.sh, this will
  build the root filesystem. see the available
  platforms in the configs folder
- copy the generated rootfs to your target system

the installer will copy any extra packages present
at the pkg folder to your rootfs/share/pkg folder.


<i>from tarball</i>

if you downloaded the tarball you can simply untar
it to your destination partition. then copy your
kernel to the boot folder.


<b>roadmap</b>

features that may fit lin0:

- make system compile itself
- improve rpi3b+ rootfs
- support mod loading and daemons in init script
- improve issue file or provide a login program: ly
- create man pages
- support rpi zero w
- support rpi cm5
- add lin0 to fetch <i>et al</i> commands
