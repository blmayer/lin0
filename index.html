<i><b>lin0</b></i>

lin0 (linux zero) is a super minimal source-based
linux meta-distribution, primarily aimed at power
users or minimalism enthusiasts. it was born from
exercises in how minimal a linux system can get.

the distro features a barebones system built from
scratch:

- the linux kernel, without initrd
- musl libc
- mksh (the myr korn shell)
- tcc (tiny C compiler)
- the init is a simple shell script

all the rest it optional and can be built from
this if needed.


<i>release notes</i>

v0.0.1: initial release


<i>usage</i>

after built the system should boot to a login
prompt, the default user is root and password is
lin0.


<i>installation</i>

the installation is a 3-step process:

- copy your kernel config to <i>configs/MODEL-linux.config</i>
- run ./make.sh, this will build the system
- copy the generated rootfs to your target system


<i>license</i>

this software is licensed under the BSD 2-clause
